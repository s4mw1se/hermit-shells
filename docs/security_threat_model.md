# Security Threat Model

Before finalizing the engineering plan, itâ€™s crucial to consider **potential threats** to or introduced by the scanner, and how to mitigate them.  
This threat model identifies what could go wrong (especially since the tool will run on **untrusted package data**) and ensures **security requirements** are addressed from the start.

---

## Assets and Trust Boundaries
- **Assets:**  
  - Source files (untrusted third-party package data)  
  - Output files (JSON, SARIF) consumed by other systems  
  - CI environment runtime  

- **Threat Actors:**  
  - Malicious package author or artifact in cache directory  
  - Malicious insider tampering with rules configuration  

- **Trust Assumptions:**  
  - CI environment is controlled by the organization  
  - Input is **untrusted**, output must remain well-formed  

---

## Threats and Mitigations

### 1. Malicious File Content Causing Code Execution
- **Threat:**  
  File triggers execution if scanner naively `exec()` or imports untrusted modules.  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - **No execution**: read as text only  
  - **No eval/import** on input files  
  - Use [`yaml.safe_load`](https://dev.to/fkkarakurt/be-careful-when-using-yaml-in-python-there-may-be-security-vulnerabilities-3cdb) for config files  
  - No dynamic code loading from rules or target files

---

### 2. Denial-of-Service via Large Inputs or Regex (ReDoS)
- **Threat:**  
  - Extremely large files or malicious regex triggers catastrophic backtracking  
  - Potential to hang scanner or exhaust CPU  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Avoid regex with nested indefinite quantifiers  
  - Consider **[RE2](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/rule-ideas)** for linear-time matching  
  - Stream files line-by-line to avoid memory spikes  
  - Optionally skip or limit files >50MB  
  - Use concurrency to prevent a single regex from blocking progress  
  - Consider Python `regex` module for timeout on match  
  - CI/container can kill stuck processes if necessary

### 3. Memory/Resource Exhaustion
- **Threat:**  
  Scanning thousands of files or millions of findings could exhaust memory  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Stream files instead of reading fully  
  - Store only necessary metadata  
  - Optionally set upper bound on findings  

---

### 4. Rogue Config File (YAML) Leading to RCE or Misbehavior
- **Threat:**  
  - Malicious YAML rule with complex regex (ReDoS) or `yaml.load` execution risk  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Always use [`yaml.safe_load`](https://dev.to/fkkarakurt/be-careful-when-using-yaml-in-python-there-may-be-security-vulnerabilities-3cdb)  
  - Validate rule structure (fields, regex are strings)  
  - Default rules packaged read-only; external configs must be trusted  
  - Document that external rule sources should be vetted

---

### 5. Output Tampering or Injection
- **Threat:**  
  - Malicious content breaks JSON/SARIF or injects misleading data  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Use Python `json` for safe string escaping  
  - SARIF library handles encoding safely  
  - Output snippet length limited and escaped  

---

### 6. Privilege and Environment
- **Threat:**  
  - Compromised scanner or dependency could pivot in CI  
  - Running as root increases risk  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Run container as **non-root**  
  - Mount only necessary directories (principle of least privilege)  
  - Minimal base image (Python 3.11 slim)  
  - Keep dependencies updated with pinned secure versions  
  - Consider AppArmor/seccomp for extra hardening  

---

### 7. False Sense of Security / Missing a Threat
- **Threat:**  
  - Tool fails to detect a vulnerable reference, leading to false confidence  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Prefer **false positives** over false negatives  
  - Rules based on **known research and patterns (S3, Azure, GCP)**  
  - Update rules as new takeover vectors appear  

---

### 8. Use of External Libraries
- **Threat:**  
  - Dependency vulnerabilities (e.g., PyYAML, Typer, SARIF libraries)  
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Use well-known libraries, pin secure versions  
  - Minimize dependencies where possible  
  - CI/container environment limits exploitation impact  

---

## Summary
By using **safe defaults**, such as [`yaml.safe_load`](https://dev.to/fkkarakurt/be-careful-when-using-yaml-in-python-there-may-be-security-vulnerabilities-3cdb),  
**safe regex practices / RE2** ([Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/rule-ideas)), and **least privilege containerization**,  
we significantly mitigate the major threats.  

The scanner never executes subject code and is resilient to both **accidental failures** and **deliberate attacks**.
